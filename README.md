# forkifyRecipe

Hello, this is budgety using javascript. you can search, shopping, like recipe, etc.

This was a code along from an instructor on online courses. I used this course to learn and understand about 
<ul>
  <li> Javascirpt ES6
  <li> Async/Await
  <li> AJAX
  <li> Node.js & NPM
  <li> Babel
  <li> Webpack
</ul>

however it's not finished yet, because I'm still studying the course.

And I'm coding while writing the appropriate explanation that I caught on how it code works (with comment), so I understand and don't forget. So if there's something wrong with the explanation in the line of code, You are welcome to edit! :)

Thank You, have good day!
